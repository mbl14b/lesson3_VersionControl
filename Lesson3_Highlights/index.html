            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control is the system that manages and records the changes to a set of files overtime. These changes are stored in one main repository for all of the project files. This acts as a way for people to make and view changes that have been made to the files overtime. As a result quick changes can be made or fixed, making viewing and editing so much simpler. This also enables issues and problems to be fixed and pin pointed much more easily.
<br><br> <img class="featurette-image img-rounded img-responsive pull-right" src="https://www.hallme.com/uploads/importance-of-version-control.png">
The version control systems (VCS) automatically notes when files were changed, who changed them, what is specifically new or different and merges changes to the same file. This allows users and team members to recall specific revisions of the files so they can be compared or restored, as there is a common repository that holds all of the latest files.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is a free and open source distributed version control system for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on these files among multiple people. It is designed to work with a range of small to very large projects, both quick and efficiently. 
<br><br> 
Git differs from other VCS as it thinks about data in different ways. Instead of keeping a set of files and all of the changes made to them over time, Git files a set of snapshots of the date. Each time a version of your project is saved, Git basically takes a snapshot of what the files look like and stores a reference to these images or shots.

                <span class="text-muted">Why Use Git?</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git acts as a mini filesystem. This mini filesystem rethinks most of the aspects of version control and has many other tools as well to differentiate it from a basic VCS. <br><br>
Most of the operations in Git will need local resources and files to function. This makes Git run much faster as it won’t have to get data from a different server. <br><br>
Git is mostly comprised of actions that would add data to the system; it is not common for data to be erased or in any action that is unfixable. Almost all of the actions in Git are stored and then checked, making it difficult for data to be changed without Git knowing about it. It makes sure information is not lost in transit or corrupted undetectably, this means that errors and issues are uncommon and almost worry free without a single point of failure. Making this system that much easier and more ideal to use.

                <span class="text-muted">The Basics of Git</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git has three main states in which its files are stored: committed, modified and staged. 
<br>
Committed is when data and files are securely stored in your local database.
<br>
Modified is when changes to the files have been made but have not been implemented directly into the database yet. 
<br>
Staged is when a user has marked a modified file in its current state to then move to the next commit snapshot.
<br><br>
 <img class="featurette-image img-thumbnail img-responsive pull-right" src="https://www.ralfebert.de/git/aenderungen-verwerfen/checkout_reset.png">
The Git as well has three main sections. 
<br>
The Git directory is the most important; it stores the metadata and object database for the projects. <br>
The working tree consists of the files that are currently being worked on, and is the checkout of a specific version of the project.<br>
The staging area, or index, is the file that stores information about what goes into your next commit. <br>
When a version of a file is edited and added into the staging area, it is considered “staged”.
When versions of the file are in the Git directory, they are considered “committed”. But when a version of the file has been modified since it was checked out, but was not staged, then it is considered “modified”.

                <span class="text-muted">Getting a Git Repository</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There is a basic set of commands that a user must know for the majority of the time using Git. In order to access a Git project, there are two main processes. First is using an existing project and importing that to Git. You would do so by tracking the existing project file by creating a repository skeleton followed by creating an initial commit. 
<br> <br> <img class="featurette-image img-thumbnail img-responsive pull-left" src="https://backlogtool.com/git-guide/en/img/post/intro/capture_intro1_4_1.png">
The other process is cloning an existing Git repository from another server. Here you would clone a repository, create a directory named grit, initializing this .git directory inside, pulling down the data for the repository and checks the working copy of the most current version.
