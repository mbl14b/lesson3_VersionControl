## Student Name:  
(Madison Levine)

## Project Description:
(In this assignment we went over code versioning. I got a hands on idea of how to work GitHub and Git. I configured Cloud9 for Git and moved these files to local and remote repositories. I then pushed the final files to those local and remote repositories. Thus I really got to understand the basic set of commands for using Git. I also worked with Cloud9 in order to create and edit my own webpage that described all of what I learned in this lesson. )

## Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. (Version control is a system that records changes that have been made to a set of files overtime so that these edits and changes can be reviewed later on.)
2. (A Git is a different type of version control system or VCS in that it saves modifications and changes in the form of snapshots instead of a list of file-based changes.)
3. (Git is more ideal in comparison to other VCSs in that it is quicker, safer and easier to use.)
